The most leftist of these companies were the Women’s Theatre Movement (1973) and Monstrous Regiment (1975) in the UK and, in the US, the New Feminist Theatre (1969).

These venues also attracted established performers from “serious” theatre, including <a href=\"?k=Sarah_Bernhardt\">Sarah Bernhardt</a>, Vaslav Nijinsky, and Anna Pavlova. The demise of the music hall began when the drinking license was withdrawn (1902). Then, with the culmination of the aftermath of World War I and the rise in popularity of the cinema, the music hall disappeared. Yet today, it is still possible to see authentic music hall entertainment, particularly in Leeds at the City Palace of Varieties and, also, in Blackpool which, in 2007, celebrated its rich history of variety and music hall with a two-gala evening performance at the Grand Theatre.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(546,'musical_director','Musical Director',NULL,' This is the person in charge of all the music, musicians, and singers in a musical.

Geiogamah’s vision for NATE was to produce plays that addressed Native American social, cultural, and identity issues. Supported by New York’s LaMama theatre company, NATE presented two plays at its premiere in October 1972: <i>Na Haaz Zaan and Body Indian</i>. <i>Na Haaz Zaan</i>, a Diné Creation Story transcribed from oral tradition and performed in its original language (with English translation provided for the audience), is designed to be played on a multi-level stage, interweaving words and highly stylized movement. <i>Indian Boy</i>, a bleak two-act play about a young boy, Bobby Lee, and his misadventures, through alcohol, is a strongly political and so highly criticized play. While <i>Indian Boy</i> is more aligned with western theatrical tradition, <i>Na Haaz Zaan</i> typifies the Native American style of <a href=\"?k=episodic_plot\">episodic narrative</a> form, evolving out of the tribal oral tradition of storytelling through song, dance, poetry, and <a href=\"?k=performance_art\">performance art</a>, and heavily symbolic folklore blended with traditional western performance elements. Under the leadership of Geiogamah, NATE has evolved into the Native American Dance Theatre, a company that comprises nineteen different tribes. In 1976, Spiderwoman Theatre was formed by Native American sisters Muriel and Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo. The Spiderwoman, a Hopi goddess of creation, weaves designs to teach people, which is the object of the company. The productions depict personal feminist stories woven together, as if into a large quilt and designed to defy the notion that “All women’s theatre is the same.”  Productions have included <i>The Lysistrata Numbah</i>! – a loose <a href=\"?k=adaptation\">adaptation</a> of Aristophanes; an adaptation of <a href=\"?k=Anton_Chekhov\">Chekhov’s</a> <i>Three Sisters</i> (<i>Three Sisters from Here to There</i>); <i>I’ll be Back</i>, a production about global survival.  A recurring theme in Native American drama, as in Native Canadian drama, is that of the trickster in society as in the founder of Indian Time Theatre (1981), Bruce King’s play <i>Evening at Warbonnet</i> (1990).  Perhaps the most significant playwright and theatre practitioner is William S. Yellowrobe (Assinbone), founder of Wakiknabe theatre company in Albuquerque, who has written over thirty plays. Particularly interesting is his play <i>Rez Politics</i> (Rez referring to Reserve) exploring identity and depicting the internalized racism between two young boys violently fighting over which of them is more Native American.

But the establishment of the Native Theatre School in the 1970s enabled Native Canadians to fuse their own native theatre experiences – tribal ritual and the oral tradition of folklore with professional theatre training. In 1982, following the 1980 International Indigenous Theatre Celebration in Toronto, the Native Earth Performing Arts company was formed (NEPA) by Denis Lacroix and Bunny Sicard to develop and promote Native Canadian theatre arts. Initially, its works were creative collaborations exploring Inuit myths and folklore (including a work in conjunction with the Native American theatre company, Spiderwoman), but by 1986, the first scripted play was produced by <a href=\"?k=Tomson_Highway\">Tomson Highway</a>, artistic director: <i>The Rez Sisters</i> (Rez being an Indian Reserve). A highly successful <a href=\"?k=comedy\">comedy</a> drama, winning prestigious awards, the play tells the tale of seven women who band together and make a trip to Toronto to participate in the world’s biggest game of Bingo. The dialogue is fast and comical as well as being touchingly effective. The first Native Canadian play staged commercially was Highway’s <i>Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapaskasing</i> (1989) at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Toronto. Again, the tone of the play is light and fast paced, but designed to shock and heavily symbolic. Situated on an Indian Reserve, the play revolves around male reaction to a woman’s hockey team, not only depicting a crisis of masculinity but also examining the deeper question of aboriginal identity, and includes both graphic on-stage rape with a crucifix, and the image of a female God (wearing a white beard and seated on a toilet).  Other notable playwrights are Drew Hayden Taylor (artistic director of NEPA 1994 -1997), whose award winning play Farewell was staged at the Factory Theatre in 1999. His play <i>Only Drunks and Children Tell the Truth</i> (1996) launched Calgary’s Crazy Horse Theatre company in 2000 and is a sequel to <i>Someday</i> (1991), a play depicting the consequences of a young Native Canadian baby forcibly separated from her biological mother and placed in the care of a white family. In <i>Only Drunks</i>, the baby, now a young woman, returns to her native reserve and mourns the death of a mother she never knew. A further play, <i>400 Kilometres</i> continues with the ups and downs of this young woman’s relationship with a man from that same reserve and the effects it has on her adoptive white parents. Despite the serious content, Taylor blends humour into his plays producing a bittersweet quality. His play <i>The Buz’Gem Blues</i> (2001) is the third of an eventual quartet of comedies reflecting Native Canadian humour. And <i>Me Funny</i> (2006) is a video collection of writings on the same subject. There are now a wide range of Native Canadian theatre companies, including Aliank Theatre Productions, the De-Ba-Jeh-Mou-Jig company on Manitoulin Island, Nakai Theatre in Whitehorse, Red Roots Theatre in Winnipeg, the Sen-klip Native.

It was through John Rich, the first manager of the Drury Lane Theatre, that harlequinades, or pantomimes, became popular in England. Rich turned these shows into a full evening’s entertainment. By the nineteenth century, a short act was added at the beginning of the harlequinade during which <a href=\"?k=harlequin\">Harlequin</a> was given a magic wand. In turn, the fairytale aspect which emerged in this opening act became the main feature of the show and gradually replaced the harlequinade. This new show became known as a pantomime.

More frequently, however, they were on street corners or at swimming pools, or on roof tops. The aim of the performer was not to present a finished polished and rehearsed performance but to explore with the audience the actual experience and impermanence of the performance itself.
